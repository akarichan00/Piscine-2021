#Learn the difference between a public key and a private key 
Public Key:
A public key is a component of asymmetric cryptography, which is a method of encryption that uses a pair of keys to perform functions - one key for encryption and another for decryption. The public key is, as the name suggests, made available to the public. It's used for two primary purposes: Encryption and Verification .

Private Key:
A private key, on the other hand, must be kept secret. It is the counterpart to the public key and is used for two primary purposes: Decryption and Digital Signatures .

#Example to understand :
Bob wants to send Alice an encrypted email. To do this, Bob takes Alice's public key and encrypts his message to her. Then, when Alice receives the message, she takes the private key that is known only to her in order to decrypt the message from Bob.
