#Note :
- Am having touble dealing with 's/^M//' shishi , when I use cat -e it kept printing '^M%' in the end of each line of the file .
-  One of the ways to remove it is to use this command ```sh sed 's/^M//'``` ,but I WANT TO USE THE CAT -E COMMAND BECAUSE THEY WANT US TO USE IT IN THIS FUCKING EXERCISE :DDD.
